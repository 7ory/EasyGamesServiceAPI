***Hi ðŸ‘‹, in order to run :arrow_forward: this ServiceAPIâš¡ with the front-end you are going to need to follow the instructions as follows:***
=================================================================================================================
- ðŸ”­ After cloning it to your :computer: machine make sure that all the underlying dependencies are successfully installed(usually happens when you clone via Visual Studio during the first build).
- ðŸ”­ Run :arrow_forward: and swagger will open, now on to the front-end, open the table.html :open_file_folder: scroll all the way down to the methods at the bottom of the page. Change the endpoint from "https://localhost:7107/Transaction"
  and swap "https://localhost:7107" with your local machine port that you will get when Swagger opens after running the API.
- ðŸ”­ Lastly to make sure the table.html :open_file_folder: hits our backend ends you need to run it in a private dev browser session :unlock:. Press WINDOWS + R on your keyboard then paste this ***(chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security)***
- ðŸ”­ it will open Chrome and you'll paste your "https://localhost:7107/Transaction" then and it should work just fine there.

Thank you for using my service and allowing me to grow. :purple_heart:
